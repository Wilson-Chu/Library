# Library
My reading list tracker.
An app to easily track down books that have been read, or will be read. Uses JavaScript, and will eventually incorporate React and a design UI (TBD).

Future improvements: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
-expand functionality to also track movies, TV shows, video games, subscription services (Netflix, Spotify, Crave, etc.)
-add thumbnails to showcase each piece of content added (APIs?)
-personal rating system for content???
