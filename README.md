# Library
My reading list tracker.
An app to easily track down books that have been read, or will be read. Uses JavaScript, and will eventually incorporate React.js and a design UI (TBD - Material UI maybe?).

Future improvements: 
-expand functionality to also track movies, TV shows, video games, subscription services (Netflix, Spotify, Crave, etc.)
-add thumbnails to showcase each piece of content added (APIs?)
-personal rating system for content???
-long-future: search functionality from an existing database (API?)
