# Library
My reading list tracker.
An app to easily track down books that have been read, or will be read. Uses JavaScript, and will eventually incorporate React and a design UI (TBD).

Future improvements: 
-expand functionality to also track movies, TV shows, video games
-add thumbnails to showcase each piece of content added (APIs?)
-personal rating system???

HAPPY NEW YEAR! 2022!!!
