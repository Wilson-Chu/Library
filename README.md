# Library
My reading list tracker, idea from The Odin Project.
An app to easily track down books that have been read, or will be read. Uses JavaScript, and will eventually incorporate React.js and a design UI (TBD - possiblly Material UI) in the future.

Future improvements: 
-proper client side form validation (stops user from progressing until required fields completed)

Long-term future improvements:
-add OAuth for account with local storage option (e.g. BaaS, Google OAuth, Auth0, etc.)
-expand functionality to also track movies, TV shows, video games, subscription services {show bill dates & prices if logged in} (Netflix, Spotify, Crave, etc.)
-add thumbnails to showcase each piece of content added (openlibrary/Cover API for this?)
-personal rating system for content vs. aggregrated reviews like Google Reviews/IMBD/Rotten Tomatoes/Metacritic/etc. (APIs???)
-title/author search functionality from an existing database (typeahead & openlibrary/Search API?)
