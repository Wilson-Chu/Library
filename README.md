# Library
My reading list tracker, idea from The Odin Project.
An app to easily track down books that have been read, or will be read. Uses JavaScript, and will eventually incorporate React.js and a design UI (TBD - Material UI maybe?).

Future improvements: 
-expand functionality to also track movies, TV shows, video games, subscription services (Netflix, Spotify, Crave, etc.) [long-term, maybe too ambitious for now...]
-add thumbnails to showcase each piece of content added (API for this?)
-personal rating system for content???
-long-future: search functionality from an existing database (API?)
-add OAuth per account and local storage options
